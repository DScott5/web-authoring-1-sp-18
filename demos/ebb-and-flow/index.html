  <!-- Main content -->
  <div class="main margin-offset">
    <p class="lead-in">Designers are ultimately tasked with keeping up with the internet’s ever-changing ways. Things are borrowed and ideas are tossed away constantly. These ideas and borrowed tactics are eventually formed into sensible, adaptable concepts.</p>
    <p>Factors such as poor eyesight visibility, screen resolution, and the platform being utilized can make adaptability difficult. You need to consider the following in order to have a successful outcome — focus on what your page will do, avoid HTML for presentation purposes, and never rely on style sheets to provide an accessible page.</p>
    <p>To make an adaptable page, use style sheets to aid appearance, not for control, and use proper percentages in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> page layouts. You may also find placing colors sparingly and avoiding point and pixel sizing will make a page more adaptable as well.</p>
    <p>Instead of worrying about the appearance of your page and the dpi difference between Mac and PC, worry about audience and functionality. This will prepare both you and your page for success, readability, and most importantly — <em>adaptability</em>.</p>
    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep it simple, do not overdo the formatting, keep it appropriate for the web</li>
      <li>Adapt to those unexpected outcomes</li>
      <li>Think about what the pages do as opposed to how they look</li>
      <li>Do not rely on pixels or color</li>
      <li>Make fonts/ font size changable per viewer</li>
      <li>Use proportional sizing so that no matter what screen the viewer is looking at, it stays proportional (using percentages)</li>
      <li class="all-caps"><span class="small-caps">Be Flexible, Adapt with Time</span></li>
