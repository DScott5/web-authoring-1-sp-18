## Course Description

Web Authoring 1 is an introductory course to authoring and publishing content for the web. Students learn to read, write, and speak HTML and CSS, as well as, study the past and present history of the web. Web Authoring 1 focuses on the basics of modern web design through a series of projects exploring type, color, image, and layout.

## Criteria for Credit

### Competencies

#### Formal

- Proficiency in writing semantic and valid HTML and CSS
- Proficiency in the use of semantic and decorative style for formal and expressive typography and design
- Proficiency in designing ease-to-use “don’t make me think” navigation
- Proficiency in designing readable and accessible content for sighted and non-sighted users
- Proficiency in the use of color for accessible and inclusive communication for sighted and non-sighted users

#### Technical

- Proficiency in the technology and tools for digital design, designing in the browser, and publishing for web
  - Illustrator, Sketch, or Inkscape, maybe InDesign, but *not* Photoshop
  - Text editor for authoring Markdown, HTML, and CSS
  - Browser developer tools for inspecting and testing
  - GitHub for development and publishing
- Proficiency in producing both low and high fidelity paper and digital comps for presentation

#### Conceptual

- Proficiency in separating content and structure from style and behavior
- Proficiency in using a mobile first and progressive enhancement design approach
- Proficiency in designing for the reader; designing an accessible and inclusive experience for all users and devices

### Attendance

Come to class. Don’t miss class, but if you need to, let me know, in advance via Slack or email; *not* 10 or 15 minutes before the start of class, but at least an hour, if you can. I’ll do the same. *Thank-you.*

Also, if you’re *illin’* and need to stay home, you can still attend class, via Google Hangouts; watch the lecture, and check-in with me via Slack. I’m flexible, just let me know what’s going on, and let’s work remotely when it makes sense.

Bottom line, don’t miss more than six (6) classes; that’s missing 3 weeks of class, and will result in a lower grade by at least 20%. For example, with six (6) absences, an “A” (94–100%) becomes a “B-” (80–82%). And, if you think you may miss more than six (6) classes, consider dropping, else you may receive a final grade of No Credit (NC).
